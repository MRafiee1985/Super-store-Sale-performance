## Key Insights and Analysis

### **1. Sales by Ship Mode**
- **Insights:** Standard Class is the most used shipping method, accounting for the highest sales, followed by Second Class and First Class.
- **Interpretation:** Standard Class may be the preferred choice for its balance between cost and delivery time. First Class sales might be increased with promotions targeting urgent delivery needs.

### **2. Sales by Category**
- **Insights:** Office Supplies lead sales, followed by Technology and Furniture.
- **Interpretation:** Office Supplies likely generate consistent revenue due to everyday demand. High-ticket items in Technology and Furniture drive profits despite lower sales volume.

### **3. Sales by Sub-Category**
- **Insights:** Phones, Chairs, and Binders are the top-selling sub-categories. Others like Tables and Machines lag behind.
- **Interpretation:** Strategies to promote underperforming sub-categories, such as discounts or bundled offers, could boost their sales.

### **4. Sales by Region**
- **Insights:** The South and West regions dominate sales, while Central and East regions underperform.
- **Interpretation:** Marketing and operational improvements in Central and East regions could enhance overall revenue.

### **5. Sales by Payment Mode**
- **Insights:** COD (Cash on Delivery) is the most preferred payment method, followed by Online and Cards.
- **Interpretation:** Encouraging online payments through incentives like discounts or cashback could streamline operations and reduce COD reliance.

### **6. Sales by Segment**
- **Insights:** The Consumer segment accounts for almost half of the sales, followed by Corporate and Home Office.
- **Interpretation:** While Consumer-focused strategies are essential, there is potential to grow Corporate and Home Office sales through targeted offers.

### **7. Sales Trends by Month and Year**
- **Insights:** Sales peak during the holiday season, especially in December. The upward trend from 2019 to 2020 reflects business growth.
